# Stroom XSLT conventions

Stroom runs XSLT 2.0/3.0 (Saxon). Declare `xmlns:stroom="stroom"` to use Stroom functions.

## Input depends on the parser before the XSLT

| Parser (template) | XSLT input | `xpath-default-namespace` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DSParser` (a text template's) | `<records><record><data name="field" value="..."/>` | `records:2` |
| `JSONParser` (a JSON template's), no text converter | JSON as `map`/`array`/`string` elements, keys in `@key`; root `/map` for JSON lines, `/array` for an array (see the JSON guide) | `http://www.w3.org/2013/XSL/json` |
| `XMLParser` (an XML template's) | the source XML | the source namespace |
| `XMLFragmentParser` with an XML_FRAGMENT wrapper converter | the fragments (one `<Event>` per line) inside the wrapper's root (`records`, or `Events`) | the fragments' own namespace, else the wrapper root's: `records:2` for a `<records>` wrapper, `event-logging:3` for an `<Events>` one |
| Indexing pipelines | `<Events>` from the Events stream, with `@StreamId` and `@EventId` on each `Event` | `event-logging:3` |

Match the record element and build one `Event` per record; the split filter hands the XSLT one
record at a time. Without the right `xpath-default-namespace` (or a prefix bound to it) a bare `match="record"`
or `select="map"` selects nothing, the output is empty text, and processing writes no Events and no error;
`check_xslt` names such expressions, and stepping reports "Output contains no XML elements".

### Namespaces, from raw input to Events

Three namespaces are in play, and each step has its own: the parser's output (what the XSLT reads), the XSLT's
output (`event-logging:3`, always), and the schema the `SchemaFilter` validates against (event-logging, picked by
`xsi:schemaLocation`). A mapping sets the first with `input` (and `xml_namespace` for XML) and the generator writes
the other two; by hand, `xpath-default-namespace` is the first and the default `xmlns` the second.

| What you see | Why | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stepping clean, but every record's output is an empty `<Events/>` (or "Output contains no XML elements"); processing writes no Events and no Error stream | The XSLT reads the input in the wrong namespace: its record template matches nothing | Read the parser's output in `step_sample` and take the root's `xmlns`: set the mapping's `xml_namespace` (or `xpath-default-namespace`) to it |
| XML fragments come out empty | A fragment with no `xmlns` of its own takes the wrapper root's: `records:2` in a `<records>` wrapper, `event-logging:3` in an `<Events>` one | `xml_namespace` = the wrapper root's namespace (`profile_sample`'s `xslt_input.namespace`) |
| JSON comes out empty | The JSONParser writes `http://www.w3.org/2013/XSL/json`; `json-to-xml()` writes `http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions` | `input: json` sets it; by hand, read the parser's output in the first, a `json-to-xml()` result in the second |
| Source XML comes out empty | Its own `xmlns` (Windows events: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event`) | `xml_namespace` = that namespace; with none, leave it empty |
| Schema errors on elements that look right (`Event`, `EventTime` "not expected") | The output elements are not in `event-logging:3` (an XSLT with no default `xmlns`, or one copying input elements with their own namespace) | Write output with `xmlns="event-logging:3"` on the stylesheet; never `xsl:copy-of` an input element into an Event |
| `schemaLocation` names a version this Stroom lacks | The `Events` root's `xsi:schemaLocation` picks the XSD | Use the configured version (`build_translation_xslt` writes it) |

## Output

Every element written below `Event` must be one the event-logging schema has: `EventTime`, `EventSource`,
`EventDetail` (holding `TypeId`, `Description` and exactly one action element such as `Authenticate`, `Process`,
`View`, `Alert` or `Unknown`), in schema order. An element the schema lacks (`EventDetail/ServerEvent`,
`Outcome/Result`) fails validation on every record; `check_xslt` refuses it and names what is allowed there,
and `build_translation_xslt` only accepts schema paths. Source values with no home go in `Data` elements
(`EventDetail/<Action>/Data` with `Name` and `Value`).

## Functions used most

Only the functions Stroom registers compile; `check_xslt` refuses any other `stroom:` name with the nearest
real one. There is no `stroom:json-parse()`: JSON in a string is parsed with `json-to-xml()`, and raw JSON by
the pipeline's `JSONParser`.

| Function | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `stroom:format-date(value, 'pattern')` | Parse a timestamp into `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. A third argument gives the input time zone (e.g. `'+10:00'`); the five-argument form also sets the output pattern and zone. A value that does not match logs a WARNING and returns empty, which then fails the schema. |
| `stroom:lookup('map', key)` | Reference data lookup through a reference loader attached to the XSLT element. |
| `stroom:meta('Name')` | A receipt header of the source stream, e.g. `Feed`, `ReceivedTime`, `RemoteAddress`, or a custom one. See `describe_stream`. |
| `stroom:feed-name()`, `stroom:stream-id()`, `stroom:record-no()` | Where the record came from. |
| `stroom:dictionary('Name')` | Text of a Dictionary doc, e.g. a field mapping table. |
| `json-to-xml(string)` | Parse JSON held in a string field into `map`/`array` elements. |
| `stroom:log('ERROR', 'message')` | Raise your own marker, e.g. for an unexpected event type. |

## Generating instead of writing

Start with `draft_translation_mapping` on the sample files: it returns a valid mapping with the input kind, the
obvious homes for fields by name (time and its pattern, host, client and server addresses and ports, user, event
type, message), a rule per kind of event and every other field as `Data`, with notes on what is still to decide
(the action element per kind, System Name and Environment, a time zone). Edit that; never send the field
inventory as the mapping. `build_translation_xslt` then writes the translation from the mapping, so the XSLT
itself need not be written by hand:

```json
{"input": "data_splitter",
 "common": [{"path": "EventTime/TimeCreated", "field": "time", "time_format": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss"},
            {"path": "EventSource/System/Name", "value": "Acme VPN"},
            {"path": "EventSource/System/Environment", "value": "Prod"},
            {"path": "EventSource/Generator", "value": "vpnd"},
            {"path": "EventSource/Device/HostName", "field": "host"},
            {"path": "EventSource/User/Id", "field": "user"}],
 "events": [{"name": "logon", "when": [{"field": "action", "equals": "login"}],
             "fields": [{"path": "EventDetail/TypeId", "value": "VPN-Login"},
                        {"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/Action", "value": "Logon"},
                        {"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/User/Id", "field": "user"},
                        {"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/Outcome/Success", "field": "result",
                         "map": {"ok": "true", "fail": "false"}},
                        {"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/Data", "data_name": "session", "field": "sid"}]}]}
```

Fields are Data Splitter names, JSON keys (`user.name` for nested keys), XML paths relative to the record, or
names from `extract`. The tool puts elements in schema order, converts times with `stroom:format-date`, leaves
elements out when their input is empty (or writes `default`), and logs records no rule matches. Unknown paths,
constants the schema does not allow, alternatives used together and missing required elements come back as
problems to fix in the mapping. Give it the `sample` too (and the `splitter` spec for text): it then reports
fields no sample record has, with the nearest names, and time formats the sample's values do not fit, before
anything is stepped.

Each value has one source and optional modifiers:

| Source | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `field` | An input field, or a name from `extract` |
| `any_of: [a, b]` | The first of these fields with a value, for sources whose variants name a thing differently |
| `value` | A constant |
| `lookup: {map, field, path?}` | What reference data holds for the key (see the reference-data guide) |
| `xpath` | A computed value (embedded JSON: `json-to-xml(...)/*/*[@key='x']`) |

| Modifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transform` | `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `strip_domain` (`DOMAIN\user`, `user@domain` → `user`), `domain`, `digits` |
| `dictionary: name` | The value a Dictionary of key=value lines gives the field |
| `map`, `default`, `time_format`, `timezone` | As before: a value map, a fallback, time parsing |

Conditions test a field with `equals`, `one_of`, `matches`, `present` or `in_dictionary` (a Dictionary of one
entry per line). Write XSLT by hand only for what none of this expresses.

### Several events in one record, repeated values, and records to leave out

- **`for_each`**: when a record is a batch (`{"host": ..., "events": [...]}`, or `<Batch><Entry/>...`), name the
  field or XPath selecting the items and each item becomes an Event. Fields, conditions and extractions then read
  the item; mark the ones that read the record round it with `scope: record` (the batch's host). The generated
  XSLT hands each item to the rules with the record as a tunnel parameter.
- **`repeat: true`** on a field whose input has several values (a JSON array, an element the record has several
  of) writes one element per value: the nearest element on the path the schema lets repeat, so
  `EventSource/User/Groups/Group/Name` with `repeat` writes one `Group` per value, and
  `EventDetail/<Action>/Data` with a `data_name` writes one `Data` per value. Nothing else may be mapped below
  the repeated element; `transform` applies to each value.
- **`drop_when`**: records (or items) to leave untranslated on purpose, each with a reason: heartbeats, test
  traffic, service accounts. They are tried before the event rules, write no Event and raise no "no mapping
  matched" warning; the reasons appear in the XSLT and the documentation. `survey_feed`'s `set_shape_handling`
  records the user's decision for an existing feed; `drop_when` is how the mapping carries it out.

The same filtering exists where other schemas are written: `build_reference_xslt` takes `drop_when` (records to
keep out of the reference data), and `draft_index_mapping` takes `drop_when` as XPath tests on an Event
(`"EventDetail/TypeId = 'Heartbeat'"`) for events the index must not hold.

### Text fields holding several values

A message string such as `2026-10-01 10:00:00 alice LOGIN Successful login from 10.0.0.1` is parsed with
`extract`: a regular expression whose capture groups become fields, usable in `common`, `events` and `when` like
any input field. An extraction can read a field an earlier one produced. Not `substring-before()` /
`substring-after()` chains, which break on the first value with a space or a missing part.

```json
{"input": "json", "json_layout": "lines",
 "extract": [{"field": "message", "regex": "^(\\S+ \\S+) (\\S+) (\\S+) (.*)$", "names": ["ts", "user", "action", "desc"]},
             {"field": "desc", "regex": "^(Successful|Failed)", "names": ["result"]}],
 "common": [{"path": "EventTime/TimeCreated", "field": "ts", "time_format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", "timezone": "UTC"},
            {"path": "EventSource/User/Id", "field": "user"},
            {"path": "EventDetail/Description", "field": "desc"}],
 "events": [{"name": "logon", "when": [{"field": "action", "equals": "LOGIN"}],
             "fields": [{"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/Action", "value": "Logon"},
                        {"path": "EventDetail/Authenticate/Outcome/Success", "field": "result",
                         "map": {"Successful": "true", "Failed": "false"}}]}]}
```

The generated XSLT holds `analyze-string(message, regex)` in a variable per template, named for the first field it
extracts (`ts_parts`), and reads each group from it; text two or more extractions read is the field's own variable
(`$message`), read once. XPath regular expressions have no lookaround and no named groups; use `(?:...)` for groups that are not
fields, and anchor the pattern. A record the pattern does not match gets no values from it, so its elements are
left out; a rule can test that with `{"field": "ts", "present": false}` (and `drop` it, or map it to `Unknown`
with `allow_unknown` set to the reason, in the user's words: a rule that writes `Unknown` for sample records is
refused without it, as the kind it singles out nearly always has an action element, and the user confirms the
reason when the XSLT is saved, seeing what those records hold). `allow_unknown` is refused for records that are
connections or logons, or whose values give a rule for each of them, with the rules to use; a schema error in an
action element is fixed, not avoided with `Unknown`. Only if the user, shown those rules, still wants Unknown (they
can say so in the chat), set `keep_unknown: true` with `allow_unknown`: they confirm it in the form, which shows
what the values suggest. Never set it to get past the refusal yourself.

A field no element of the schema means (a rule id, a byte count, a vendor's key) is carried as `Data` (a path ending
`/Data`, with `data_name`) on the element it describes: `destination_key` under
`EventDetail/Network/Connect/Destination/Data`, a source zone under `.../Source/Data`, anything else under the action
element itself. Never invent an element for it, and never leave the event `Unknown` because of it. A rule's
`data` list is short for those: `"data": ["rule_id", "bytes_sent"]` carries each as Data of the rule's action
element, named after the field. Keep it when you change the element; the drafts use it. A build's
translation XSLT written by hand (`save_xslt`) whose records come out as `Unknown` doesn't step clean: only
`build_translation_xslt` can agree Unknown with the user.

## Style

The mapping's `style` decides how the XSLT reads. Take it from an XSLT style section in the standing instructions
(AGENTS docs) when there is one, or from what the user asks for; otherwise leave the defaults:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `naming` | `snake_case` | Variables, templates, modes and the XSLT's own functions: `client_ip`, `event_source`, `action_to_success`. Also `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `kebab-case`. |
| `variable_min_reads` | 3 | A field read this often in a template (its guard and value are two reads) goes in a variable. Fewer reads stay inline; text two extractions read is always a variable. 1: always variables. |
| `variables` | `just_in_time` | Where variables are declared: `just_in_time`, immediately before the first element that reads each, inside the innermost element holding every read; `top`, at the start of their template (or of the one rule that uses them). |
| `inline_map_max_keys` | 3 | A value map used by one element with at most this many keys is written inline as an `if`; longer or shared ones become one `xsl:map`. 0: always `xsl:map`. |
| `function_min_uses` | 2 | A conversion this many elements use (a time format, or a `strip_domain`, `domain` or `digits` transform) is declared once as an `xsl:function` (`mcp:parse_time`, `mcp:strip_domain`) and called; fewer stay inline. 0: always inline. |
| `data_values` | `interpolated` | How a computed `Data` value is written: `interpolated`, `<Data Name="x" Value="{...}"/>`; `attribute`, `<Data Name="x"><xsl:attribute name="Value" select="..."/></Data>`. An expression holding a brace keeps `xsl:attribute` (or its variable). |
| `data_names` | `as_given` | `Data` Names in a style, applied to every `data_name` of the mapping: `server_node` is `ServerNode` in `PascalCase`; a name already in the style is kept (`IPAddress`). Also `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `kebab-case`. The names are the mapping's own from then on, so the documentation and the index fields follow them. |
| `layout` | `modes` | `modes`: each event kind is a template rule with its own mode (`match="node()" mode="eventTypeLogon"` with `camelCase` naming), applied to the record with `select="."` from the record template's `xsl:choose`; parts several kinds share are mode templates too. `named`: the same with named templates and `xsl:call-template`. `inline`: every kind written in the `xsl:choose`. |

Elements that come out the same in several rules (EventTime, EventSource, ...) are written once, in a template of
the layout's kind, whatever the style.

Each rule's template is headed by a comment saying what it does: the records it handles (its conditions, or
"records no other rule matches"), the event it writes (action element and TypeId), the fields it reads (which are
extracted, and from what), and, for a rule kept `Unknown`, why. A shared template's comment names the rules that use
it. Nothing to write by hand: they come from the mapping.

## Regular expressions in a mapping

An `extract` regex is written once, as XPath reads it: a literal `[` is `\[`. Only the JSON of the call doubles
each backslash (`"\\["`); the server puts the regex in the XSLT as it is, so nothing escapes it again. Copy the
separators from the sample text exactly: an en dash (–) is not a hyphen. `build_translation_xslt` runs each regex
on the sample's text: one that matches none is a problem that says where it stops matching and what the text has
there (naming characters such as an en dash or a no-break space); one that matches only some is a warning with a
text it misses. Fix what it names, rather than the escaping.

## Reuse

Existing pipelines `xsl:import` shared XSLTs by document name (e.g. `IP Lookup`) and keep field
mappings in Dictionary docs. Find them with `find_documents (content=...)` and `describe_template`
before writing new code, and check imports resolve with `check_xslt`. A mapping uses a shared XSLT two ways:
its named templates through `shared` (called in the element's place), and its `xsl:function`s through
`functions` (`href`, `prefix`, `namespace`, as `describe_template`'s `shared_xslt` gives them), called in any
xpath: `"xpath": "gs:parseTimestamp(data[@name='eventtime']/@value)"`. Conditions compare strings, so test a
boolean function as `string(gs:isLocalIpAddress(...))` with `equals: 'true'`. An xpath calling a prefix that
no `functions` entry binds is a problem. Stroom steps the XSLT with its imports; the local checks skip these
xpaths.

## Checking a draft

1. `check_xslt` for well-formedness, namespaces, function names and imports.
2. `step_pipeline` with `draft_code` for one record, then `step_sample` with `draft_code` for all of
   them. Nothing is saved; errors come back per record and element.

## Less repetition, by the generator

Extractions that differ only by the key they find in one text field (`key="..."` for thirty keys) become one function
a shape, called with the key: `mcp:quoted_value($body, 'dstintfrole')`, in place of an `analyze-string` variable a key
declared again in every template that reads it. A part several rules write the same way is written once as a template
of its own and applied from each (EventSource, and below an action element, a Source, a Destination, a Rule or an
Outcome: the action element itself, Deny or Permit, Authenticate or View, may differ). These come from the mapping,
which is what is changed; the XSLT is regenerated from it.
